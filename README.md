## A maze-style Pacman-esque game where you play as a ball trying to find all coins on the screen.

## Movement: use the arrow keys to move the ball in the directions keys point towards. This can also be done using WASD keys.

## Collect all the coins to beat the game! You'll know you've won when the game over text appears on screen.

## This tutorial taught me how to program 3D games in unity: https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2022.3
